# xboxdrv

Xbox 360 controller

Messing around to see if I could use a container to run `xboxdrv` on my Ubuntu laptop, while streaming from my Windows desktop.

I went down this path since it uses python2 and I was trying to isolate it, so you may need to install `python-is-python3`, then `poetry`, then `xboxdrv` for this too work.
